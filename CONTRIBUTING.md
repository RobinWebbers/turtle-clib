# Contributing

Hey there, if you didn't already read this in the readme. I'd love for anyone to
actively contribute in any form. Reporting bugs, coding and even just suggesting
what to add to the library is well appreciated. I'd like this to be a place
where noobs can learn how functions and more experienced coders can pick up a
copy of the library so they don't have to code simple things which over and
over.
