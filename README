# Turtle C Library

Hi there fellow c programmer,

To make my (and probably your) life easier, I've made some c libraries. Use them
as you please. If you find any bugs or things I could improve on, I'd be glad to
hear.

## Usage

Use the Makefile in the root directory of this repository to compile the
libraries:
- To make a specific library, set the target to the corresponding directory.
- To set the target of the Makefiles of the libraries, set "ARGS" (e.g. to clean
  all libraries: make ARGS=clean)
